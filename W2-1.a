; This program reads in two arbitrary (positive or negative)
; integers m and n and outputs the product of m and n, 
; without using the multiply machine instruction.
; It reads m and n, and then stores the sign of m in the
; variable sign and replaces m with absolute value of m.
; Next it adds m copies of n to itself to get the product of
; abs(m)*n.  Finally, it multiplies this product by sign, to
; get the final answer, which it outputs.
; It is for the Wombat2 computer.

; Roles of the registers:
; A0 holds n
; A1 holds abs(m), which is decremented in a loop
; A2 holds the sum so far
; A3 holds the constant -1 for decrementing m
	 
	loadc A3 -1	; load -1 -> A3
	load A0 IO	; read n -> A0
	load A1	IO	; read m -> A1
	loadc A2 0	; load 0 into A2

Start:	jmpz A1 pos  	; Start: jump to Done if m = 0.
       	add A2 A0	; add n to the sum in A2
	add A1 A3       ; decrement A1 by 1
       	jump  Start	; go back to Start

pos:	store A2 IO	; pos: output the final sum in A2
       	exit  		; stop
