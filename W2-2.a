; This program reads in integers until the integer -999 is input then outputs
; the average of the integers (excluding the final -999) and quits.

; Roles of the registers
; A0 holds the sum of the user inputs
; A1 holds a counter
; A2 holds the most recent user input
; A3 holds a copy of A2 to be manipulated when checking for termination condition
; A4 holds 999
; A5 holds 1

	loadc A0 0	; loads 0 into A0
	loadc A1 0	; loads 0 into A1
	load A4 check	; loads 999 into A4
	load A5 one	; loads 1 into A5

Start:	load A2 IO	; stores user input to A2
	move A3 A2	; copy A2 to another temporary register A3
	add A3 A4	; add 999 to the temporary register
	jmpz A3 Avg	; jump to end if user input is -999
	
	add A0 A2	; add the user input to the sum in A0
	add A1 A5	; increment the counter
	jump Start	; go back to start

Avg:	jmpz A1 End	; check if the counter is 0 to prevent dividing by 0
	divide A0 A1	; find the mean by dividing the sum by the counter
	store A0 IO	; output the average

End:	exit		; stop

; variables
one:	.data 2 1	; constant 1
check:	.data 2 999	; constant 999
